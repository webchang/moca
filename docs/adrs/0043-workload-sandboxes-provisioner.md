# ADR-0043: A separate `moca-provisioner` is the only MOCA component that creates workload sandboxes

- **Status:** Proposed <!-- Proposed → Accepted → Superseded by ADR-NNNN / Deprecated -->
- **Date:** 2026-10-16
- **Deciders:** MOCA team
- **Spec:** [`../specs/2026-10-16-workload-sandboxes-design.md`](../specs/2026-10-16-workload-sandboxes-design.md)

## Context

Phase 2 of `/workloads` (#476, per-workload sandboxes and storage) gives each workload its own
sandbox pods, with its Context PVC mounted. On Kubernetes, P6 (the process-manager runtime) has
no component that can create a pod today:

- The supervisor, its workers, the relay and the sandboxes run with
  `automountServiceAccountToken: false`. The workers process model output, so they stay without a
  token on purpose.
- The control plane has a token, but only for a Role on Secrets in `moca-credentials`. It also holds
  the signing keys and the credential store, so MI1 §4.3 rates its compromise as "everything".
- Context Service used to create sandboxes. rossoctl/context-service#51 (Sandbox provisioning
  removed) took that out: MOCA owns execution, Context Service owns storage.

Whatever creates workload sandboxes also renders a pod spec from request data, holds RBAC in the
sandbox namespace, and is where a workload's owner and its storage meet.

## Decision

We will add **`moca-provisioner`**, its own Deployment in the `moca` namespace. It is the only MOCA
component with Kubernetes permissions in `moca-sandbox`: one Role to create and delete a
workload's StatefulSet, its headless Service and its attach-token Secret, and to read pods and
PVCs. Amended 2026-10-22: it also creates and deletes each workload's PVC (spec §5), which Context
Service no longer provides for phase 2.

- Workers call its internal API with a service token, and forward the caller's API token. The
  provisioner verifies that token itself and takes the owner from it.
- It signs each workload's attach token with its own Ed25519 key. The relay verifies the token with
  public keys and sets `moca.dev/workload` and `moca.dev/owner` from it, never from `Hello`.
- It seeds that PVC from the Context's frozen revision, exported by Context Service as in phase 1.
  It no longer resolves a Context Service claim, so rossoctl/context-service#40 is off phase 2's
  path.
- It runs the orphan reconciler.

The control plane, the supervisor and the relay stay without Kubernetes permissions.

### Alternatives considered

- **A provisioner inside the control plane.** No new Deployment, but it puts pod-spec rendering and
  sandbox RBAC into the most privileged, internet-facing process.
- **The supervisor's workers.** Refused in #476: they run model-influenced code.
- **agent-sandbox `Sandbox` CRs.** A backend, not an owner: something still needs RBAC on the CRs,
  and every install would need the CRD and its controller. Kept as a later backend for its warm
  pools.
- **Context Service creating sandboxes again.** Reverses context-service#51's ownership boundary.
- **Static per-user sandboxes** (MI1 §9.1 option B). No dynamic workloads, and operator toil per
  user.

## Consequences

- Positive: the new permission is held by the smallest component, in one namespace, with no
  rights on Secrets or pods in `moca`.
- Positive: workload labels in `sh:sandbox:records` become trustworthy without a new store; the
  workers can still write Redis, but not a valid signature.
- Positive: MI1 §9.1's option A (a launcher that creates a user's container) exists on Kubernetes.
- Negative / accepted cost: one more Deployment, signing key and internal endpoint to operate.
- Negative / accepted cost: a compromised provisioner can create pods in `moca-sandbox` and mount
  any workload's PVC there. A ResourceQuota bounds the first; nothing but its small surface bounds the
  second. It cannot read Secrets (its Role has no get or list on them), and a
  ValidatingAdmissionPolicy holds the pods it creates to their own token Secret, their own
  ServiceAccount and no host access, so it cannot borrow the shared pool's token or another
  identity. That policy needs Kubernetes 1.30 or newer.
- Negative / accepted cost: one replica only; the owner cap is serialized in process.
- Negative / accepted cost: it provisions only the container tier. P4 (microVM) hosts sit outside
  the cluster and need a host-side provisioner.
- Follow-up owed: the MI1 §2.3, §9.1 and §13 amendments; and the relay's Exec check
  becoming a real boundary once MI1 S2 grants name the user.

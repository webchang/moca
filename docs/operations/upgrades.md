# Upgrades

> **Preview.** For P6 on Kubernetes ([`deploy/k8s`](../../deploy/k8s/README.md)). The repository documents no
> rollback procedure; what is below is what the scripts and manifests do.

## Upgrading means passing a new image

`deploy/k8s/setup.sh` is idempotent: re-running it with the same inputs only reconciles. It never rotates a secret,
and with nothing changed no pod restarts. **On the base and OpenShift targets, re-running with the default
`:latest` upgrades nothing**: the pod template is unchanged, so nothing rolls and no newer `latest` is pulled (a pod
that restarts for another reason may re-pull it, by chance). An upgrade there means passing a new `--image`, a tag or,
better, an `@sha256` digest. On Kind a rebuilt image rolls the pods (below). A re-run reads the stored inputs, applies the whole kustomization in one `kubectl apply -k`, then waits for each component
in order: Redis, relay, supervisor, control plane (only if a GitHub client id is set), sandboxes. There is no
per-component ordering inside the apply itself.

Inputs are **sticky**: a variable you leave unset keeps its stored value, and one set to the empty string usually
clears it. Exceptions: an empty `SH_SANDBOX_COUNT` counts as unset and keeps the stored count; `--image` and
`--sandbox-image` cannot be empty (reset them by passing the default explicitly); `SH_WAIT_SECONDS` is not sticky.
They live in two ConfigMaps you can inspect:

```bash
kubectl -n moca get configmap moca-settings moca-setup -o yaml
```

## Which image runs

| Target     | Images                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base / OCP | `ghcr.io/rossoctl/moca:latest` and `ghcr.io/rossoctl/moca-remote-worker:latest`; `--image` and `--sandbox-image` override them and are stored. A `@sha256` reference becomes a digest pin |
| Kind       | Locally built `dev.local/...:local`. `setup.sh` stamps the image id on the pod templates, so a rebuilt image rolls the pods and an unchanged one does not                                 |

Redis and the OpenShift TLS sidecar are pinned by digest. **The harness image is not digest-pinned by default** and
is `:latest`; pass `--image <ref>@sha256:...` to upgrade and to make the upgrade repeatable. An old `latest` may
predate `/readyz`, in which case the supervisor never becomes Ready.

## How each component rolls

| Component     | Strategy                                                                                             | What you will see                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supervisor    | Rolling, `maxUnavailable: 0`, `maxSurge: 1`                                                          | A new pod must become Ready first; in-flight turns on the old pod get the drain below                                                                |
| Relay         | `Recreate`, one replica; runs the **harness image**                                                  | **Every harness image change recreates it**: all sandboxes and P4 hosts detach and in-flight turns fail and are retried                              |
| Control plane | One replica, default strategy (rolling, 25%/25%: one extra pod, none unavailable); grace period 30 s | The new pod must pass `/readyz` before the old one goes, so no planned gap in login or exchange (it runs 0 replicas when no GitHub client id is set) |
| Redis         | StatefulSet, one replica                                                                             | See [Redis backup and recovery](redis-backup-recovery.md)                                                                                            |
| Sandboxes     | StatefulSet, rolling one pod at a time (highest ordinal first), each waiting for Ready               | Pod-local workspaces are lost: a rolled or restarted sandbox resets every container session's workspace **silently**                                 |

A settings change rolls the supervisor and control plane through a settings-hash annotation. Because the relay
runs the harness image, any `--image` bump recreates it. The first apply of a P6.3 release also recreates the relay and
rolls every sandbox on **every** stack, tiered or not (new environment variables on the relay and sandboxes). Do both
at a quiet time.

## What an in-flight turn experiences

On a supervisor rollout the pod waits for the endpoint to leave the Service (5 seconds), then drains: workers stop
taking turns, the listener closes, and the supervisor waits up to **20 seconds** for in-flight turns. A detachable
turn still running at **15 seconds** is aborted with the message `harness restarting`. The 120-second pod grace
period is only an outer bound. Practically:

- A turn longer than about 15 to 20 seconds does not survive a rollout. The committed session does; the work in
  that turn is lost.
- Attach streams on a draining worker end without a terminal frame; a client re-attaches to another worker.
  I did not verify that `mocactl` does this automatically.
- The supervisor is PID 1, so its exit takes the workers with it.

## Version skew

- **Harness before control plane.** Config bundles require the harness to be upgraded first: an older harness
  ignores `configRef`, so turns run without the skills and report no error. Nothing enforces this order, and the
  supervisor, control plane and relay use the same image, so one `--image` bump moves all three and they roll in
  parallel (the rule is in [ADR-0038](../adrs/0038-mocactl-config-bundle-promotion.md) and the
  [promote guide](../guides/promote-claude-workflow.md)). For a release whose notes say it changes config-bundle handling, roll the supervisor
  first (see below). Do not split the image to get this ordering.
- **Tier lists must match.** `SH_SANDBOX_TIERS` and `SH_SANDBOX_DEFAULT_TIER` are read by both from the same
  ConfigMap.
- **No schema version.** There is no schema-version key or migration tool for Redis. New fields are handled by
  tolerant reads. The only versioned artefact at rest is the credential envelope (`v1.`).
- No wire-version negotiation exists. `GET /v1/discovery` returns the control plane's `version`.

### Rolling the harness before the control plane

_Unverified: this uses plain Kubernetes commands and has not been run against `deploy/k8s`._ Pause the control
plane's rollout, apply the upgrade, and resume the control plane from a second terminal once the supervisor is Ready:

```bash
# terminal 1
kubectl -n moca rollout pause deployment/moca-control-plane
deploy/k8s/setup.sh --target kind --skip-build        # your usual flags, including --image

# terminal 2, in parallel
kubectl -n moca rollout status deployment/moca-supervisor
kubectl -n moca rollout resume deployment/moca-control-plane
```

`setup.sh` waits on the control plane for up to 300 seconds. Resuming it from the second terminal lets the script finish
normally, so its sandbox and presence checks still run. If you cannot resume in time, `kubectl rollout status` on a
paused Deployment is expected to keep waiting and then fail at that timeout; the script then skips the sandbox and
presence checks, and you should resume and run them yourself:

```bash
kubectl -n moca-sandbox rollout status statefulset/moca-sandbox
kubectl -n moca exec redis-0 -- sh -c 'redis-cli HLEN sh:sandbox:records'   # should equal SH_SANDBOX_COUNT
mocactl doctor
```

For releases that do not change bundle handling, skip all of this: the window is short and only affects sessions
that use a promoted bundle.

## Rolling back

No procedure is documented. Mechanically, re-running `setup.sh` with an older `--image` rolls the Deployments back,
and plain `kubectl rollout undo` also works. Redis data is not versioned, so a rollback across a data-format change
is untested.

## Availability during a node drain

There is no PodDisruptionBudget, anti-affinity or topology spread in the manifests, and Redis, the relay and the
control plane are single replicas. Drain nodes one at a time and expect a gap.

# Operations

> **Preview.** These pages are for operators of **P6 on Kubernetes** ([`deploy/k8s`](../../deploy/k8s/README.md)),
> the first path planned for Stable. Facts come from the manifests, `setup.sh` and the code as of 2026-10-13. Where
> something is not documented anywhere in the repository, the page says so rather than guessing. Single-VM and
> Compose notes appear only where they differ.

## Gaps you should know about

These are properties of the current deployment, not documentation omissions:

- **Single points of failure.** Redis, the relay, the control plane and (by default) the supervisor each run one
  replica, and there is no PodDisruptionBudget or anti-affinity, so a node drain can take them all at once.
- **No tested backup or rollback procedure** exists in the repository.
- **Sessions have no TTL** and per-session Redis memory has not been measured, while Redis is limited to 256Mi.
- **`/metrics` is JSON, not Prometheus format**, and the relay and sandboxes have no health endpoints.
- **A drain protects only short turns** (about 15 to 20 seconds), although the pod's grace period is 120 seconds.
- **No capacity numbers are published.** The worker and turn defaults are trial values, not measurements.

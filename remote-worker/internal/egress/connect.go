//
// k bounds the tunnel as a whole: both legs refresh the one clock, and it is
// refreshed per read and per write, so only a tunnel where nothing moves at
// all expires. Both legs and both directions matter. A half-closed tunnel
// leaves exactly one leg running, so bounding only the guest's reads would
// leave a client that sent CloseWrite and then waits on a silent upstream
// holding its slot indefinitely; and bounding each leg separately would expire
// a healthy one-way transfer, which is the case this shape exists to protect.
// Because an expiry is a copy error, it lands in the arm that already tears
// both conns down.

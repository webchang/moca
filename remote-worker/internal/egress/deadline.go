// This file holds the one idle bound shared by both data paths. Everything an
// established connection does — tunnel copies, the forwarded request, its
// response — goes through one of these wrappers, so a connection is closed
// only after `idle` with no byte moving on it, never because a long transfer
// ran out of absolute time.
//
// The bound refreshes rather than arming once. That distinction is the whole
// point: an absolute deadline would kill a slow but healthy `git clone`, and a
// refreshed one cannot, because every byte pushes it out.
//
// A zero or negative duration is a no-op, so a Config built by hand in a test
// keeps the old unbounded behaviour. NewProxy never leaves the bound zero.

// idleClock is one kind of activity and the deadlines it keeps alive. A socket
// deadline is per direction of one socket, so refreshing only the deadline of
// the socket a wrapper happens to touch does not express a bound on the
// established *connection* — and it kills a long one-way transfer mid-flight.
// During a `git clone` the guest sends nothing for as long as the pack takes to
// stream down, so a guest-only read deadline expires on a perfectly healthy
// tunnel; a forwarded upload fails mirrored, because http.Transport's readLoop
// blocks reading the upstream conn from dial time while only the request body
// is moving. One byte must therefore push out every deadline that byte proves
// is still live.
//
// Which deadlines a given activity proves live is not "all of them", which is
// why this is a set of targets per kind of activity rather than one clock per
// connection. Delivering a response to a guest shows the guest is *reading*;
// it says nothing about the request body it promised and never sent, so it
// must not excuse that. The call sites name the distinction.
//
// No watchdog goroutine is needed: a deadline applies to calls already blocked
// in Read or Write, not just later ones, so writing the clock through to the
// sockets *is* the enforcement. That also keeps every expiry a timeout error,
// which serve's loop and splice's copy-error arm already classify correctly,
// rather than the ErrClosed a watchdog's Close would produce — and it adds no
// per-connection goroutine to a process shared by every VM on the host.

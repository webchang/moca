# Cluster-free, root-free, systemd-free tests for microvm-worker.service and
# microvm-vms.slice (Task 17). Neither unit can be exercised for real here -- that
# needs systemctl, a real host, and root -- but the unit FILES' contract can rot
# silently the same way build-snapshot.test.sh's manifest contract can, and a rotted
# contract reintroduces spec §6's #1 practical failure (a worker crash leaks VMs)
# without any test ever going red:
#
#   - KillMode=control-group kills every process left in THIS UNIT's own cgroup on
#     stop/crash. It does NOT reach the VM cgroups: those are siblings of the unit's
#     cgroup under the slice, not children of it (see microvm-worker.service's own
#     header for the tree). An earlier version of this comment claimed otherwise --
#     the false premise behind the final review's H1 -- and correcting it is why the
#     start-up sweep is the load-bearing half of the mitigation, not an extra.
#   - Slice=microvm-vms.slice puts the worker in the SAME slice SweepOrphans walks on
#     the next start, and the same one both launcher arms' per-VM cgroups (jailer
#     --parent-cgroup / systemd-run --scope --slice=) nest under
#     (hardware-corrections D1/D3: "configured consistently ... or the two
#     mechanisms fight and the leak we are preventing returns").
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE STRUCTURALLY CANNOT CHECK, stated so the gap is not rediscovered:
# it greps unit-file TEXT and cannot evaluate the Go code those files configure, which
# is exactly how H1 -- an interaction between Slice= here and SweepOrphans there --
# stayed invisible to it. That interaction is pinned instead by
# remote-worker/internal/vmpool/cgroup_unitfile_test.go, which reads THESE files and
# runs the real sweep predicate against the cgroup name systemd derives from them.
# Anything asserted here about how the units meet the code is a cross-reference to
# that test, not an independent check.
#   - AssertPathExists=/dev/kvm fails the unit before ExecStart even runs -- spec §6:
#     "fail the unit at start ... never fall back to running commands on the host."
#   - LimitMEMLOCK=infinity keeps the unit's own ceiling from being the thing that
#     silently caps VM density (spec §7.5: a kernel limit mistaken for a density
#     ceiling fails at 500 VMs after working at 20).
#   - SH_MAX_COMMITTED_MB must be set and non-zero: main.go's poolConfig refuses to
#     start without it (the memory gate is mandatory, not a default).
#   - MemorySwapMax=0 on the slice keeps a ballooning guest's OOM kill fast and
#     attributable (in-cgroup) instead of a slow host-wide swap thrash.
#   - No SANDBOX_TOKEN= literal in either file: spec §5.2's invariant that nothing
#     secret enters a checked-in artifact, mirroring build-snapshot.test.sh's
#     identical check on the snapshot build script.

# This is the only check in this suite that evaluates the units rather than grepping
# their text, and it used to be structurally unable to fail: `systemd-analyze verify`
# was INSIDE the `if` condition, so a unit that failed verification took the else
# branch and was reported as a skip, and when it passed the assertion was
# check ... "0" "0" -- a literal compared with itself.
#
# Asserting on the exit status alone does not work either, and this is measured, not
# assumed: on ubuntu:24.04 (systemd 255) `systemd-analyze verify` exits 1 for this unit
# exactly as shipped, with one diagnostic --
#
#   microvm-worker.service: Command /usr/local/bin/microvm-worker is not executable:
#   No such file or directory
#
# -- which is a fact about the CHECKING host, not about the unit. CI (ubuntu-latest,
# where systemd-analyze exists and is the reason this check matters) is such a host, so
# `check "$rc" "0"` would be red on every PR and would get deleted again.
#
# So: assert that every diagnostic OTHER than that one is absent. Everything the unit
# itself can get wrong -- an unknown key, an unparsable value, a bad section header, a
# unit that fails to load -- prints its own line and fails this. The exit status IS
# asserted directly wherever it is meaningful: for the slice (which has no ExecStart),
# and for the service on a host that actually has the binary installed.
#
# Scoped to lines naming the unit under test, which is what "about the unit itself" means
# and what keeps this honest across host upgrades. `systemd-analyze verify` also reports
# on units it pulls in transitively, and the ubuntu-latest move to Ubuntu 26 (systemd 258)
# made that non-empty on a stock runner:
#
#   /usr/lib/systemd/system/walinuxagent.service:21: Support for option CPUAccounting=
#   has been removed and it is ignored
#

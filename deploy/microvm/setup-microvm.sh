#
# Installs the P4 microVM tier NEXT TO an installed P6 (deploy/vm/setup-vm.sh): the microvm-worker
# binary, its unit and slice, and the wiring that attaches it to P6's relay under its OWN relay
# token (#369). It reads P6's installed relay.env and never writes a P6-owned file: the relay learns
# the new token through a systemd drop-in that loads a separate env file.
#
# Prerequisites: P6 installed and running; /dev/kvm; Firecracker + jailer in /usr/local/bin; a golden
# snapshot at $MICROVM_SNAPSHOT_DIR (build-rootfs.sh, then build-snapshot.sh -- see P4-ON-P6.md);
# Go, unless MICROVM_BIN (and MOCA_EGRESS_BIN) name prebuilt binaries.
#
# A HOST WITH CONTAINER SANDBOXES TOO (P6.3, docs/specs/2026-10-04-p6-on-kubernetes-slice3-design.md
# §7) is made tiered rather than refused: when any sh-sandbox-* container exists, running or stopped,
# this script writes microvm-tiers.env and drop-ins that load it into sh-supervisor and
# sh-control-plane, so each session stays in the tier it was created in. A P4-only host stays untiered.
# Before it writes anything, every RUNNING container sandbox must advertise moca.dev/tier=container
# in its presence record (a pre-P6.3 image advertises none, and a tiered host would exclude it); a
# stopped one cannot be checked and is warned about.
#
# Usage: sudo ./deploy/microvm/setup-microvm.sh [--remote BUNDLE_DIR]      (re-running changes nothing)
#
# --remote BUNDLE_DIR (P6 on Kubernetes, docs/specs/2026-10-04-p6-on-kubernetes-slice2-design.md §5):
# attach this host's worker to a relay in a cluster, over TLS, instead of to a local P6. The bundle is
# the directory deploy/k8s/setup.sh wrote for this host's ID; its token replaces a local one (the
# cluster is the token authority), and MICROVM_SANDBOX_ID comes from it. No relay drop-in, no podman,
# no installed P6 needed. The one local change: tier files an earlier mixed run wrote are removed, and
# the installed units try-restarted, since this host's own P6 is container-only once its only microVM
# worker attaches elsewhere. moca-egress (P4.1) is installed and started in both modes, since the
# worker unit references it. Running again without --remote switches back.
#
# Env overrides: SH_UNIT_DIR, SH_ENV_DIR, SH_BIN_DIR, MICROVM_SANDBOX_ID, MICROVM_WORKSPACE_IDLE,
# MICROVM_SNAPSHOT_DIR, MICROVM_BIN, MOCA_EGRESS_BIN, MOCA_EGRESS_ALLOW (seeds a NEW moca-egress.env
# only), MOCA_EGRESS_READY_TIMEOUT (seconds to wait for its control socket, default 30),
# MICROVM_ATTACH_TIMEOUT, MICROVM_ATTACH_SETTLE (--remote: seconds
# an attach must hold before it counts, at least 1) -- defaults below -- and
# MICROVM_MAX_COMMITTED_MB (unset by default): a VM-memory budget in MiB for a host smaller than the
# shipped unit's 24 GiB, written as a drop-in that also lowers the unit's AssertMemory to match -- and
# SH_SANDBOX_DEFAULT_TIER (container or microvm): the tier of a session created without one, on a host
# with both tiers. Sticky, like deploy/k8s/setup.sh's: unset keeps the value in microvm-tiers.env (else
# container), and set but empty clears it back to container. Given on a host that ends up untiered
# (P4-only, or --remote), it is not recorded, and a log line says so.

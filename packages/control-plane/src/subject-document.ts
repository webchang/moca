 * per subject, k8s-secret-store.ts) with the annotations and `data` map folded into one object:
 *
 *   { "v": 1, "credentials": { "<name>": { "descriptor": {...}, "sealed": "v1.<iv>.<tag>.<ct>" } } }
 *
 * The same invariants carry over unchanged:
 * - the document is addressed by the subject's HASH, so every access is a lookup by exact key and
 *   no backend needs a list/enumerate permission (spec §6.5);
 * - only `sealed` is secret, and it is envelope-encrypted with `subject|name` as AAD, so a reader of
 *   the backend gets ciphertext and a writer cannot relabel one subject's row into another's;
 * - the descriptor sits OUTSIDE the ciphertext, so `list` decrypts nothing (spec §6.2).

 * back untouched; entries are parsed only to answer `get` and `list`.
 *
 * Rebuilding the document from what this version understood and writing THAT back would make the
 * first put or delete for a subject silently erase every row it skipped. With several Vault-backed
 * replicas that is a rolling upgrade (or rollback) in which an older replica deletes each credential
 * a newer one wrote. The Kubernetes store never had the problem: it merge-patches single keys.

 *   for dropping a retired KEK is "no credential has opened under a non-primary key for N days", and a

 * - On failure, the error gains the subject hash. `open`'s own message names the credential, but a
 *   credential name is user-chosen and collides freely across subjects, so without the hash an
 *   operator knew some users were broken and could not enumerate which. The hash is already every
 *   store's object-name input, so it discloses no login, and it reaches no caller: `writeError`

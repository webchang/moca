 * Stream-id scheme (M5 cutover): each entry is stored with the explicit id
 * `"<position>-0"` (e.g. `"3-0"`), enabling O(tail) seeks in `read(fromPosition)`.
 * Sessions written by pre-M5 code used `"*"` (auto-generated ids) and are NOT

  /**
   * Connect, and RE-ARM on failure so a transient outage costs one call rather than the process.
   *
   * `ready` used to be assigned once here and never reassigned, so a single rejected `connect()` left
   * a permanently REJECTED promise that every method awaited. Redis coming back changed nothing; only
   * a restart cleared it.
   *
   * Worth being precise about which failures reach that path, and about what KEEPS them reaching it.
   * Probed against the pinned `redis@6.2.1`: a REFUSED connect rejects with `ECONNREFUSED` and a
   * black-holed SYN rejects with `ConnectionTimeoutError` once the 5s default `connectTimeout` fires.
   * In a cluster the second is the one to expect -- a Service with no ready endpoints, or a
   * NetworkPolicy drop, black-holes the SYN rather than refusing it. (That shape costs ~60 s to
   * reject, against ~5.5 s for a refused port at this bound -- see redis-errors.ts.)
   *
   * Both of those rejections were previously a SIDE EFFECT of having no `'error'` listener, and this
   * class now has one. That is why the client is built with `resilientClientOptions`: its bounded
   * reconnect strategy is what still abandons a hopeless attempt (as `ReconnectStrategyError`) once the
   * listener has consumed the error that used to do it. Without the bound, `connect()` would retry
   * forever, never settle, and this re-arm would never fire -- a wedge in place of a crash.
   *
   * That was survivable while callers built one backend per turn: a blip cost exactly one turn and
   * the next turn built a fresh client that connected. It stops being survivable the moment one is
   * memoised process-wide (run-turn.ts's `sharedSessionStore`), where the same unlucky moment --
   * most likely the FIRST turn after boot, the window the old per-turn leak never mattered in --
   * would poison every remaining turn for the worker's lifetime. The async path makes that worse
   * than a stall: the failure classifies as retryable (classify-outcome.ts), so the queue entry is
   * redelivered to the same poisoned process and fails instantly again -- a hot retry loop with no
   * backoff and no terminal state.
   *
   * Clearing the memo on rejection is what lets the next call retry instead of replaying the
   * original error. The identity check keeps a late failure from clearing a NEWER attempt, and the
   * side `.catch` is bookkeeping only -- callers still see the real rejection through the promise
   * they awaited, while a rejected connect that nobody is awaiting yet can no longer surface as an
   * unhandled rejection.
   *
   * That `.catch` covers the PROMISE channel only. The event channel -- an `'error'` emitted on the
   * client itself -- is what `swallowRedisErrors` is for, and it is the one that killed workers.

   * Await the live connect attempt, starting a fresh one if the last one failed OR the socket was
   * permanently closed.
   *
   * Two channels can break the connection and only one of them rejects a promise. `arm()`'s `.catch`
   * covers the promise channel. The event channel is the one past `resilientClientOptions`' reconnect
   * bound: node-redis sets `isOpen` false, swallows its own `ReconnectStrategyError`, and rejects every
   * later command with `ClientClosedError` -- while `ready` stays RESOLVED from the connect that
   * succeeded, so nothing here would notice. See resilientClientOptions for the citations.
   *
   * Re-arming on `!isOpen` is safe: `connect()` throws `Socket already opened` only when `isOpen` is
   * true, which this branch excludes, and the terminal path clears `isOpen` BEFORE returning the error,
   * so the re-attempt genuinely happens.
   *
   * It also means a call after `close()` reconnects rather than rejecting. Deliberate, and not worth a
   * `closed` flag: the only closers are `sharedSessionStore`'s URL-change branch and
   * `resetSharedSessionStore()` (test-only), both of which are discarding the store anyway.

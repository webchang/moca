/**
 * `mocactl sbx codex` (#593): Codex CLI pointed at this sandbox for one run.
 *
 * Why a launcher and not agent configuration, as `up` writes for Claude Code and OpenCode: Codex
 * reads no project-local config. A `.codex/config.toml` in the repository is not read at all
 * (verified against codex-cli 0.163.0 and 0.164.0: with the file present and the cwd inside the
 * repository, `codex mcp list` is empty and `codex doctor` reports `config.toml ~/.codex/config.toml`,
 * `MCP servers 0`), and `codex mcp add` has no project scope. Writing `~/.codex/config.toml` would
 * point Codex at this sandbox in EVERY repository on the machine, which `up`'s contract (ordinary
 * files in your working tree, `git status` shows them, `sbx rm` takes them back) cannot express.
 *
 * `-c` carries the server for one invocation instead, and leaves nothing behind.
 *
 * NOT the containment `up` gives Claude Code. `--disable shell_tool` turns off Codex's shell tool,
 * but `unified_exec` runs local commands too and CANNOT be disabled: both `--disable unified_exec`
 * and `-c features.unified_exec=false` are ignored (it stays `stable true`). A real session with
 * `shell_tool` off does reach for the sandbox tools in practice — every tool call was `sandbox.bash`
 * — but that is the model's choice, not a denial. Codex's own sandbox (`sandbox_mode`,
 * `approval_policy`) is the protection that remains, and it is process confinement, not tool denial.

/**
 * The environment the spawned `mocactl sbx mcp` needs and would not otherwise get. Codex does not
 * pass its own environment to a stdio MCP server: the child sees only Codex's allowlist (HOME,
 * PATH, SHELL, USER, LANG, TERM, TMPDIR, TZ, …), the CA variables, and whatever the server names in
 * `env_vars` (#639 review). Claude Code and OpenCode pass everything, so this is new with Codex.
 *
 * Without these the server would read a different login and target a different control plane than
 * the launcher did: `MOCACTL_SBX_URL` for the control plane, and the XDG pair because
 * `sbx-auth.json` and the flight recorder live under them. A name that is unset is skipped by
 * Codex, so listing all three is safe.

 *
 * With no `id`, `mocactl sbx mcp` resolves the binding itself, as it does for Claude Code, so the
 * agent follows `up`'s binding rather than a copy of it. An explicit `--sandbox ID` is passed on,
 * so it reaches the server that is actually started rather than being accepted and ignored; so is
 * an explicit `--control-plane-url`, which otherwise would steer only the launcher.
 *
 * `id` and `url` are interpolated into TOML. Both are validated before they get here: `id` against
 * `SANDBOX_ID_RE` (anchored, `sbx-` then lowercase alphanumerics) and `url` by `normalizeUrl`,
 * which yields an https origin. Neither can carry a quote or a brace.
